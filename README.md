# PHPølse
PHPølse - the Wurst routing game

Trivia: The word `Pølse` is Danish for `Wurst`.

The purpose of the game is to collaborate to create a way for the PHPElephant to get to the Wurst. you will be given different pieces and have to work together to create the path.

1. Run `composer install`
2. Create a database called `wurst` with username `wurstUser` and password `wurstPassword`
3. Import the sql file in `sql/wurst.sql`
4. You need a virtual host defined (routing needs your web root to be e.g. wurst.dev)
